# 🦀 Rust Learning

Welcome to my Rust learning journey! This repository contains hands-on projects, mini-programs, and code exercises from the **"Rust: The Complete Developer's Guide"** course by [Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-the-complete-developers-guide/) on Udemy.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is focused on building a deep understanding of the Rust programming language, from its core fundamentals to advanced features such as ownership, borrowing, traits, error handling, and memory safety.

I’ll be uploading code alongside each module to solidify concepts through real-world projects.
